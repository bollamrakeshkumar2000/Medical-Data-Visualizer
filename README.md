## Medical Data Visualizer

FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python - Project 3

## Project Description
Visualization and analysis of medical examination data to explore relationships between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Features
- **Categorical Plot**: Comparison of health indicators between patients with and without cardiovascular disease
- **Heat Map**: Correlation matrix showing relationships between different medical parameters
- **Data Cleaning**: Filtering of incorrect medical measurements
- **BMI Calculation**: Overweight classification based on height and weight

## Visualizations Created
1. **Cat Plot**: Shows counts of cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity, and overweight status for patients with/without cardio disease
2. **Heat Map**: Displays correlations between all medical parameters with upper triangle masked
